# eCommerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project created to visualize and analyze eCommerce sales data. The dashboard provides insights into various sales metrics, including sales by country, category, market, and mode, as well as key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Project Overview

The eCommerce Sales Dashboard includes the following visualizations and interactive elements:

- **Sales by Country**: Displayed using a donut chart to compare sales distribution across different countries.
- **Top 3 Countries in Sales**: Visualized using a map to highlight the top-performing countries based on sales.
- **Sales by Category**: Presented in a column chart to provide insights into which product categories generate the most sales.
- **Sales by Market**: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across various markets.
- **Sales by Mode**: Visualized using a funnel chart to analyze sales performance by different modes (e.g., online, in-store).
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Important KPIs such as total sales, number of transactions, and average order value are displayed to provide an at-a-glance view of business performance.
- **Slicers**: Two slicers have been added at the bottom of the dashboard to allow users to filter the data and enhance interactivity.
